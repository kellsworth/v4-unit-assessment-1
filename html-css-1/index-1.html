    <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth
      and
      latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification
      is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple,
      Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext application Technology Working Group(WHATWG).
      <br>
      HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"
      status in October 2014. It's goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
      new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
      devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with
      older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4 but also XHTML1 and DOM Level2 HTML.
